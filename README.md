<h3><strong>SUBWAY</strong></h3>

[![SensioLabsInsight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/e85826fc-c1cb-47f1-9448-2a04b7b00eb1/big.png)](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/e85826fc-c1cb-47f1-9448-2a04b7b00eb1)

Subway is a plugin for WordPress that allows you hide the content of your website to non-logged in visitors and only displays them to logged in users. 

This plugin redirects the users to the provided login page with a login form that allows them to type their username/email and password combination. 

It validates the users’ credentials and displays a set of configurable messages (via apply_filter hook) if there are errors such as invalid username, empty username, wrong password, and etcetera.

The plugin has settings inside the Administration Panel (‘Settings’ > ‘Reading’) that allows you to configure where you want the user to be taken after he/she has successfully logged in, this can be a page, a custom URL, or just the default behavior.

<h3><strong>Caveats</strong></h3>

Subway is only built for WordPress website owners to redirect non-logged in users to a custom login form. This plugin is not a replacement for Membership websites where a complex set of configurations are allowed. There are no payments model, subscriptions, and role types.

Subway is good for Private Intranet Websites where membership is required.
